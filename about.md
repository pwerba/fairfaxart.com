###Artist’s Statement:  
With my recent mixed media work I am exploring the **idea of a quilt:** *parts and layers linked together to make a whole*.  I use translucent material to investigate how light and shadows can either be controlled or create interesting contrasts of chance.  
I try to use as much found and recycled materials as possible. I appreciate the notion that these materials add an additional element of history to the piece; i.e. wood framing that was once a fence picket, and tissue that once wrapped a gift becomes a background. 
I have always enjoyed using birds and animals in my art.  I like to learn how other cultures symbolize these creatures, and then construct my own interpretation.   Most recently, I have focused on *studies* or quick compositions where I depict stanzas of poetry from Wallace Stevens and John Keats.  My attempt is to create a “mind’s eye view” of the poet’s verse.
